Twitter Streaming App

The twitter streaming app streams five twitters  from the #NowPlaying hashtag and shows a twitter timeline 
from  the city where the user  opens the application. 

To build this app I choose  Django-Python, web framework,  I feel comfortable working 
with it and  it has different features and libraries easy to install and use. 

To connect  to to the Twitter Api I used a feature called Django-twitter Tag, it   
allows us to call the tweet objects and query the different characteristics present in 
the Json Files.(of course as a dict in Python).
In the index file I added   the tags  calling  Tweet character√≠stics like text and screen_user among others, 
The tags are working properly.


In order to perform IP-based geolocation I installed the GeoIP2 library, I wrote inside the views.py the variables 
to retrieve  the user IP and and from that information, I queried the latitude and longitude 
from the city we want to stream, this var named lat_long is  tagged inside the index in the line 51 where it calls 
the geocode attribute. 


The time spend on this projects was three business days.
